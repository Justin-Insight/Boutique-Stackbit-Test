  heading: Our Clients Say It Best ...
  featured_testimonial: "“I met Barbara to pick out and order hearing aids. Barbara is a consummate professional. She is extremely understanding, caring and patient. Her interpersonal skills are excellent. Barbara treated me as if I were a family member. At the conclusion of the meeting I told Barbara, ‘I feel as if I won the lottery when you took my case.’ Now, several years later, I still feel as if I am a family member when I visit Barbara.”"

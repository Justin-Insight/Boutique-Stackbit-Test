  subhead: Boutique Hearing is a concierge audiology practice revolutionizing the way hearing aids are fit.
  copy: "Audiologist Dr. Barbara Corbett, Au. D., owner and founder of Boutique Hearing, travels to her clients’ home or office for all audiology services from the hearing evaluation to hearing aid selections, fittings, and follow-up care. 


  Dr. Corbett has over 20 years of experience helping people hear better. Her journey as an audiologist at the University of Chicago Medicine; Hearing Health Center; Phonak and Presence Resurrection Medical Center have given her a unique perspective into all aspects of audiology from diagnosis to manufacturing and most importantly with individualized patient care. 


  Throughout her career, Dr. Corbett has been passionate about helping people hear better. Early on she realized that, while advancements in hearing aid technology and design were important, what mattered most was her patient’s knowledge of their hearing needs and success with their hearing aids. Dr. Corbett noticed that, despite all the advancements in hearing aid technology, the process of programming and fitting them was not evolving. People were still coming into a quiet office for their fitting, then being sent into complicated listening environments that were part of their everyday lives. Dr. Corbett wanted more for her clients which is why she founded Boutique Hearing and disrupted this status quo. 


  Boutique Hearing was founded with an energetic spirit and firm objective: enhance lives by improving hearing. Having hearing loss is difficult but finding the time to address it should not be. That is the driving force behind Boutique Hearing: convenient, precise, and customized hearing aid fittings in the comfort of your home or office."
